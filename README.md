# faboy
arduboy clone for the fablab of Sion (CH)

## idea for v2 
  * NRF24l for a wireless communication
  * capacitive button
  * coin-cell battery / thin film battery 
  * different switch pattern
  * ARM processor 
  * solar cell

## issues 
  * bad usb connector (mmini b instead of micro b !)
  * backside QR code difficult to read (only with a good application)
  * power plane Vin and MOS_to_Switch connected
  * difficult to find a gnd test pad on the top 
  * battery operation crash after a small moment
